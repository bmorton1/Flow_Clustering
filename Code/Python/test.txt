******No Lie Feat Drake
 by 2 Chainz
******
I am smoking on that gas, life should be on Cinemax

Movie, bought my boo bigger tits and a bigger ass

Who he’s, not I, I smoke strong, that Popeye

Louie V’s in my archives, black diamonds, apartheid

Bread up and my top down, on the block with a block out

Hit ya ass with that block-ow, dope enough to go in yo nostrils

I take ya girl and kidnap her, feed her to my mattress

A skeleton in my closet, it's probably one of these dead ass rappers

It's probably one these pussy ass niggas, don’t try me I’ll pull that trigga

Got ya car note in my cup, and your rent in my swisha

That pussy so good I miss you, head game’s so vicious

And all I get is cheese like I’m taking pictures

******Pouches Of Tuna ft Roc Marciano 
 by Action Bronson
******
Been on the honor roll, sculptures of my body out in Nagano

My shawty features like Madonna, Lo designer

Bending these young Lola Fellanas over. Ace the test

Baste the breast with the juices

Under the influence of fly shit, I glide like Ovechkin

Disqus hoody, puff hibiscus, balance be the crispest

Baby girl, you're wylin if you sniff this

You gotta take a piss test, piss right through your fishnets

Robert Moses State Park, lamb in the sand

Blam blam a piggie try to put my fam in the can

Strictly cop and go's, until we laid in the Galapagos

Eating tacos, higher than a opera note

We never ride Civics, the Mont Blanc scripted lyrics

It's like avant garde to the critics

I throw you in that armbar with the quickness

Either you with me or bitch you on the shit list

I keep it playa while some choose to play it safe

Boy check the resume, it's risky business in the A

And I been witness to this history, ever since the 10th grade

We went from rockin' braids to temp fades

I twist my A hat to the side just for style

Or throw on the Gucci bucket with the flowers, super fly

Wow, the southern pride been known to shut it down

It ain't so country though nigga, this ain't no Gomer Pyle

I'm Sergeant Slaughter, I keep my shit cooked to order in order

To satisfy my people in Georgia and 'cross the water

And across the border the eses are gettin' smarter

They got flour for tortillas and lettuce for enchiladas

If you follow, wink wink, no doubt, we don't speak

In a blink those folks could have you sleeping in the clink

I'm shittin' on niggas and peein' on the seat

It's that nigga the B-I-G B-O-I, O-U-T

...
Skipping Who's down to fuck a lot
...
Skipping 
...
I'm still not a player, but you still a hater

Elevator to the top, ha see you later, I'm gone

Penthouse suite, Penthouse freaks

In-house beats French comteese, 10 thou' piece

Rent-out lease with an option to buy

Copping a 5-0 Benz for when I'm not far up in the sky

Puffing the lye from my Twinzito

Up in the Benzito with my kiko from Queens nicknamed Perico

We go back like PA's and wearing PJ's

Now we reach the peakage, running trains for three days

Who want to ride it; won't cost you a dollar

Whether soft or harder of course you still gonna holla

My my, I'm big huh

I rip my prick through your hooters

I'm sick, you couldn't measure my dick with six rulers, hold up

Choola, I'm all about getting loot

But I knock that boot if you out to get koofed

So GOOD she won't put my tattoo on it

Bottom line is, you the finest

Gave you a new name, what's that? My bitch

Hold up, hold up, whoa there, let's capture this moment

If I hit it then I own it, marijuanin' every mornin

And patroning girl, we groaning

But that pussy got me feeling like a kid

With the street lights on, street lights on?

You know I gotta go in 'til it’s

Skipping Please don't take it personal

Skipping And I know deep down it hurt your soul
...
Skipping But I'm a blue collar worker, girl
...
Skipping Now its a long road ahead of me
...
Skipping 
...
Now it's a long road ahead of me

Eyes wide open, trying to rock my flow steadily

Trying to stay focus so these broads dont get to me

But dog it gets hard cause they seem so heavenly

Humming Stay With Me trying to make my day as sweet

As aunt Tiombe on a Sunday with a cup of Angel's tea

I'm trying to find the happiness that couples claim to be

But it's hard to balance loving when you busting over beats

Sounds strange but it's hard to explain it over beats

In the lab daily rocking two or three shows a week

Going mad crazy stressing over press and your release

Trying to please labels while you keep your rep up in the streets

At the same time trying to breath

And on my down time, trying to find a fine breeze

But see im underground so now I gotta find cheese

Just to take her out to dinner

Just to eat and get a kiss up on the cheek

But for me it's even harder

Cause I ain't got a car to pick them up in

So chicks already think they put enough in

Plus im kind of cute so its hard for them to trust him

Asking what im doing every night like I be screwing every night what

Truth is, im bruising every mic that I come across

And every now and then, drop a hundred off

Just so you can fucking floss, but that's not enough for you

So I take another loss, wondering why I fucked with you

Knowing I got stuff to do

Chance, acid rapper, soccer, hacky sacker

Cocky khaki jacket jacker

Slap-happy faggot slapper

Iraqi rocket launcher

Shake that Laffy Taffy, jolly raunchy rapper

Bang, bang, bang - skeet, skeet, skeet

She do that thing for three retweets

The album feel like '92

Now take that bong 'fore he three-peat

Chance, ho, acid head, cruising on that LSD

Asked Joseph about my deal

He looked back said "hell yeah, let's eat!"

******The Corner
 by Common
******
Skipping [Produced By: Kanye West]
...
Skipping 
...
Memories on the corners with the fo's and the mo's

Walk to the store for the rose, talking straightforward to hoes

Got uncles that smoke, and some put blow up they nose

To cope with the lows, the wind is cold and it blows

In their socks and their soles, niggas holding they rolls

Corners leave souls opened and closed, hoping for mo'

With nowhere to go, niggas rolling in droves

They shoot the wrong way, cause they ain’t knowin' their goals

The streets ain’t safe cause they ain’t knowing the code

By the foes I was told, either focus or fold

Got cousins with flows, hope they open some doors

So we can cop clothes and roll in a Rolls

Now I roll in a Olds, with windows that don’t roll

Down the roads where cars get broken and stole

These are the stories told by Stony and Cottage Grove

The world is cold, the block is hot as a stove

On the corners

Black-cloaked jeans, cross-color shirt

Jansport knapsack, that is where I keep the work

And by work, I mean weed

I'm a mac, but I rock A.P.C

No Microsoft, no Hodgman

Spiderfang fly to the point it's a problem

The ?-colored blues, b, I got 'em

The Moltaracci shoes, b, I got 'em

Hot roddin', geo-Prism ridin'

Verrazano Bridge ten bucks and I glide in

So clean like I put extra Tide in

Thorough on the block, cause the kid extra tied-in

On the low from the Jake in the Taurus

Quati boots, like I'm in the motherfucking forest

But I'm not hunting a duck, man

I'm out here grinding, hunting a buck

My mom used to dress me in Conway

Now I rock the pink Polo shorts, no Kanye

All day not giving a fuck

Seinfeld style, not giving a fuck

Neuromancer, perfect blend of technology and magic

Use my rappin so you all could see the hazards

Plus entertainment where many are brainless

We cultivated a lost art of study and I brought a buddy

Automator harder slayer fascinating combinations

Cyber warlords are aggravating abominations

Arm a nation with hatred we ain't with that

We high-tech archeologists searching for knicknacks

Composing musical stimpacks that impacts the soul

Crack the mold of what you think you rappin for?

I used to be a mech soldier but I didn't respect orders

I had to step forward, tell them this ain't for us

Living in a post-apocalyptic world morbid and horrid

The secrets of the past they hoarded

Now we just boarded on a futuristic spacecraft

No mistakes black it's our music we must take back

******Let Me Ride
 by Dr Dre

Y'all know me, still the same O.G. but I been low-key

Hated on by most these niggas with no cheese, no deals and no G's

No wheels and no keys, no boats, no snowmobiles, and no skis

Mad at me cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries

Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks

To add to the wall full of plaques

Hanging up in the office in back of my house like trophies

Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze, ho please

You better bow down on both knees

Who you think taught you to smoke trees

Who you think brought you the oldies

Eazy-E's, Ice Cubes, and D.O.C's

The Snoop D-O-double-G's

And the group that said motha fuck the police

Gave you a tape full of dope beats

To bump when you stroll through in your hood

And when your album sales wasn't doing too good

Who's the Doctor they told you to go see

Y'all better listen up closely

All you niggas that said that I turned pop

Or The Firm flopped

Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been getting no sleep

So fuck y'all, all of y'all

If y'all don't like me, blow me

Y'all are gonna keep fucking around with me and turn me back to the old me

Alive, and I'm a famous rapper

Even when the paths are all crooked-y

I can show you how to dosey-doe

I can show you how to scratch a record

I can take apart the remote control

And I can almost put it back together

I can tie a knot in a cherry stem

I can tell you about Leif Ericson

I know all the words to "De Colores"

And I'm proud to be an American

Me and my friends saw a platypus

Me and my friend made a comic book

And guess how long it took

I can do anything that I want, cause look

No way, you'll never make it

Come with the weak shit, I'll break it

Step into my zone, mad rhymes will stifle ya

Lines like rifles go blast when I kick some ass

A lot of rappers be like one-time wonders

Couldn't say a fly rhyme if there was one right under

Their noses, I hate those motherfucking posers

But I'm so real, to them it's scary

And with my unique skills, nah, you can't compare me

And no, we don't make wack tracks

And all the suckers get pushed back when I'm kicking real facts

I represent, set up shit like a tent, boy

You're paranoid cause you're a son like Elroy

And you'd be happy as hell to get a record deal

Maybe your soul you'd sell to have mass appeal

A real gangsta-ass nigga never runs his fucking mouth

Cause real gangsta-ass niggas don't start fights

And niggas always gotta high cap

Showing all his boys how he shot em

But real gangsta-ass niggas don't flex nuts

Cause real gangsta-ass niggas know they got em

And everything's cool in the mind of a gangsta

Cause gangsta-ass niggas think deep

Up three-sixty-five ayo 24/7

Cause real gangsta-ass niggas don't sleep

And all I gotta say to you

Is when the fire dies down what the fuck you gonna do

Shop at Urban Outfitters

All your other clothes is straight vintage

Top flannels around yo waist

Wearin' boots and panties in the winter

Hit the club with all of yo club homies

‘Cause your real friends can't get in

You will never wait in no lines

You already text the promoter man, man

And he thirsty and he wants you

But you use him for his club

Just to get close with a nigga with a table

A baller, a rapper, or even sell drugs

‘Cause you just want the plug and you got that

‘Cause you just want the light and you got that

And maybe if you get a little closer they might really fuck with you

Let you a ride with the top back

You just want love and affection

What they do is on to the next one

‘Cause if you ain’t down for the action

You gon get yo ass kicked outcha section

The best living or dead hands down, huh

Less talk, more head right now, huh

And my eyes more red than the devil is

And I'm about to take it to another level, bitch

No matter who you go and get

Ain't nobody cold as this

Do the rap and the track, triple double no assists

And my only focus is staying on some bogus shit

Arguing with my older bitch, acting like I owe her shit

I heard that people sing raps to give the track pain

Bought the chain that always give me back pain

Fucking up my money so yeah I had to act sane

Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent

Chick came up to me and said

"This the number to dial

If you wanna make your #1 your #2 now"

Mix that Goose and Malibu I call it "Malibooyah"

Goddamn, Yeezy, how he hit them with a new style?

Know that motherfucker well: "What you gonna do now?

Whatever I want to do. Gosh! It's cool now"

Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now

Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out

Cause you'll never get on top of this

So mommy, best advice is just to get on top of this

Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?

Put the pussy in a sarcophagus

Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus

Head of the class and she just want a swallowship

I'm living in the future so the present is my past

My presence is a present, kiss my ass

Hope to take the pain away from the feelin' that he feel today

Cause you are, you are, a loner, loner

No wonder our lives is caught up in the daily superstition

That the world is 'bout to end, who gives a fuck? We never do listen

Now when the sun come up

I'll be there to say what up

In the morning brush my teeth

Find that clip I been looking

For since last night

I feel so caught up in a bud

I flow some round in my bedroom, turn around, see myself in the mirror

I guess I'm cool, and no sappy thoughts in my head

I'm feeling like I'm Peter Pan, minus the tights

And the fairy's happy to see how far I've come, to the same place

It began: my dream and imaginations

Perfectly at peace so I move along a bit higher

******Lost Ones

She told me everything don't always work the way you want it

I said I'm only trying to get as close as I can get

I left her laying by her lonesome early in the morning

Didn't even tell her nothing, I just said I had to dip

I'm speeding down the highway now, my top down

Breeze in my head will keep me cool cuz I'm hot now

Heated, miss me with love I don't need it

I was born to be a legend, it was written... nigga read it

This is life music, that having problems with your wife music

Neck to the edge of the knife music

Please, a few pills past the recommended dose

Swear another Advil could probably turn me to a ghost

I'm off one, listening to Lauryn Hill "Lost Ones"

At 40,000 feet everything looks awesome

Even the coupes turn to itty-bitty dots

You can't even see the niggas you could only see the blocks

So check out the hoes my Cadillac fills

20-inch wide, 20-inches high

Ho, don't you like my 20-inch ride?

20-inch thighs make 20-inch eyes Hoping for American 20-inch pies

Pretty-ass clothes, pretty-ass toes

Oh, how I love these pretty-ass hoes Pretty-ass, high-class, anything goes

Catch 'em in the club throwing pretty-ass bows

Long john drawers, long john stalls

Any stank puss make my long john pause

Women on their cell making long john calls

And if they like to juggle, get long john's balls

[Hook]

All my players in the house that can buy the bar

And the ballin-ass niggas with the candy cars

If you a pimp and you know you don't love them hoes

When you get on the floor (nigga throw dem bows)

All my women in the house if you chasing cash

And you got some big titties with a matching assWith your fly-ass boots or your open-toes

When you get on the floor (nigga throw dem 'bows)

Player, give me some brew and I might just chill

But I'm the type that like to light another joint like Cypress Hill

I'm-a steal doobies, spit loogies when I puff on it

I got some bucks on it but it ain't enough on it

Go get the S-t. I-d-e-s

Nevertheless I'm hella fresh, rolling joints like a cigarette

So pass it across the table like ping pong, I'm gone

Beating my chest like King Kong

It's on wrap my lips around a 40

And when it comes to getting another stogie fools all kick in like Shinobi

No, he ain't my homie to begin with

It's too many heads to be proper to let my friend hit it

Unless you pull out the fat, crispy

5 dollar bill on the real before it's history

Cause fools be having them vacuum lungs

An if you let em hit it for free you hella dum-da-dum-dumb

I come to school with the Taylor on my earlobe

Avoiding all the thick teasers, skeezers, and weirdos

That be blowing off the land like where the bomb at

Give me two bucks, you take a puff and pass my bong back

Suck up the dank like a Slurpee

The serious bomb will make a niggy go delirious like Eddie Murphy

I got more Growing Pains than Maggie

Cause homies nag me to take the dank out of the baggie

Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with

The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe

The mind activation, react like I'm facing time like

Pappy Mason, with pens I'm embracing

Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets

Suede Timbs on my feet makes my cipher complete

Whether cruising in a Sikh's cab or Montero Jeep

I can't call it; the beats make me falling asleep

Smoking on dubs in clubs, blowing up like Cocoa Puffs

Sipping bub, getting perved and getting dubbed

Daps and hugs, mean mugs and shoulder shrugs

And it's all because accumulated enough scratch

Just to navigate it, wood decorated on chrome

And it's candy painted

Fans fainted while I'm entertaining

Wild, ain't it

How me and money end up hanging

I hang with Hannibal Lector, hot shit

So feel me when I bring it

Sing it loud

I'm from the Lou and I'm proud

Run a mile for the cause

I'm righteous above the law

Player my style's raw

I'm Born to Mack like Todd Shaw

Forget the fame and the glamour

Give me D's with a rubber hammer

So I typed a text to a girl I used to see

Sayin' that I chose this cutie pie with whom I wanna be

And I apologize if this message gets you down

Then I CC'ed every girl that I'd see-seed 'round town

And hate to see y'all frown but I'd rather see her smilin'

Wetness all around me, true but I'm no island

Peninsula maybe, it makes no sense, I know crazy

Give up all this pussy cat that's in my lap, no lookin' back

Spaceships don't come equipped with rear view mirrors

They dip as quick as they can, the atmosphere is now ripped

I'm so like a pimp, I'm glad it's night

So the light from the sun would not burn me on my bum

When I shoot the moon, high jump the broom

Like a preemie out the womb, my partner yelling "too soon

Don't do it! Reconsider, read some liter-

-ature on the subject. You sure? Fuck it

You know we got your back like chiroprac-tic

If that bitch do you dirty we'll wipe her ass out in some detergent

Now hurry hurry go on to the altar

I know you ain't a pimp, but pimp remember what I taught ya:

Keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart

Hey keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart

Man these girls is smart, Three Stacks, these girls is smart

Play your part...play your part."

Standing on the verge of your success

Steady bearing your soul to the world, you undressed

Surrounded by your successors and the whores you ain't fucked yet

Two brothers, two peas in a pod, two comeback seasons apart

Take it back to when I be in the park

Then rhyme 'til I couldn't see in the dark

So silly niggas betta be on ya guard

Long as breath is in my being, I'mma be on my job

With good music, got that good feel

A good meal, leafy greens, two veggies, protein and a starch

And I'm out

Skipping

Here we go

Once upon a time not long ago

When people wore pajamas and lived life slow

When laws were stern and justice stood

And people were behavin' like they ought ta good

There lived a lil' boy who was misled

By another lil' boy and this is what he said:

"Me and you, Ty, we gonna make some cash

Robbin' old folks and makin' tha dash"

They did the job, money came with ease

But one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease

He robbed another and another and a sista and her brotha

Tried to rob a man who was a D.T. undercover

The cop grabbed his arm, he started acting erratic

He said "Keep still, boy, no need for static"

Punched him in his belly and he gave him a slap

But little did he know the lil' boy was strapped

The kid pulled out a gun, he said "Why did ya hit me?"

The barrel was set straight for the cop's kidney

The cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure

"I'll do years if I pull this trigga"

So he cold dashed and ran around the block

Cop radioes it to another lady cop

He ran by a tree, there he saw this sista

A shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her

Looked around good and from expectations

So he decided he'd head for the subway stations

But she was coming and he made a left

He was runnin' top speed till he was outta breath

Knocked an old man down and swore he killed him

Then he made his move to an abandoned building

Ran up the stairs up to the top floor

Opened up the door there, guess who he saw?

Dave the dope fiend shootin' dope

Who don't know the meaning of water nor soap

He said "I need bullets, hurry up, run!"

The dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun

He went outside but there was cops all over

Then he dipped into a car, a stolen Nova

Raced up the block doing 83

Crashed into a tree near university

Escaped alive though the car was battered

Rat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered

Ran out of bullets and still had static

Grabbed a pregnant lady and out the automatic

Pointed at her head and he said the gun was full o' lead

He told the cops "Back off or honey here's dead"

Deep in his heart he knew he was wrong

So he let the lady go and he starts to run on

Sirens sounded, he seemed astounded

Before long the lil' boy got surrounded

He dropped the gun, so went the glory

And this is the way I have to end this story

He was only seventeen, in a madman's dream

The cops shot the kid, I still hear him scream

This ain't funny so don't ya dare laugh

Just another case about the wrong path

Straight 'n narrow or yo' soul gets cast

I can exercise you, this can be your Phys. Ed

Cheat on your man ma, that's how you get ahizzead

Killer with the beat, I know killers in the street

With the steel that'll make you feel like Chinchilla in the heat

So don't try to run up on my ear

Talking all that raspy shit, tryna ask me shit

When my niggas fill ya vest they ain't gone pass me shit

You should think about it, take a second (Ding)

Matter fact, you should take four B

And think before you fuck with lil Skateboard P

From the 'jects to the penthouse

Synonymous to what my life been 'bout

Kinetic energy, brain waves of intelligence, is what I send out

Still in the cutlass doing spin outs

'87 boxed up all tinted out

Living life on the edge, couple links that excite the feds

Shout to mister jones

Its funny how sparkling stones bring attention from these hater heads

A lot of changing faces from these potato heads

Eyes dilated when I sashay lifted

Couple doobies in the ashtray, cash clay run my mouth like a Sunni champion

The long beard, hides the pain I be dancing in

The reign with the Pharoahs, mirror image to the gods

My homie glory brings head nods, the only story I been bout

This controlled mind with no facade

The dreamy intuition from a street politician is scarred

Back and forth with the pimps and gang land symbolers

Dope boys with the bang in they trunk

See the tremblers

Milq city where im from, where the opie emblems

Street names after indians, so wild cowboys watch where you coming in

Tomahawks with assault rifles

May bump into the next king pin or Haile Selassie

Civil with the spiritual

This city feels unlucky searching for a miracle

On this elevator ride skipping floors

Trying to reach the top, then the structure falls (falls)

We sell, crack to our own out the back of our homes

We smell the musk of the dusk in the crack of the dawn

We go through episodes too, like Attack of the Clones

Work til we break our back and you hear the crack of the bone

To get by, just to get by

Just to get by, just to get by

We commute to computers

Spirits stay mute while you egos spread rumors

We survivalists, turned to consumers

Just to get by, just to get by

Just to get by, just to get by

Ask Him why some people got to live in a trailer, cuss like a sailor

I paint a picture with the pen like Norman Mailer

Mi Abuela raised three daughters all by herself with no help

I think about her struggle and I find the strength in myself

These words, melt in my mouth

They hot, like the jail cell in the South

Before my nigga CORE bailed me out

To get by, just to get by

Just to get by, just to get by

We do or die like Bed-Stuy through the red sky

With the window

Of the red eye

Let the lead fly, some G. Rap shit, Living to Let Die

Lost generation, fast paced nation

World population confront their frustration

The principles of true hip-hop have been forsaken

It's all contractual and about money makin

Pretend-to-be cats don't seem to know they limitation

Exact replication and false representation

You wanna be a man, then stand your own

To MC requires skills, I demand some shown

I let the frauds keep frontin

And roam like a cellular phone far from home

Giving crowds what they wantin

Official hip-hop consumption, the 5th thumpin

Keeping your party jumping with an original somethin

Yo, I dedicate this to the one-dimensional

No imagination, excuse for perpetration

My man came over and said: "Yo we thought we heard you"

Joke's on you; you heard a biting-ass crew but um

From the percentage of youngins winning without no college

I'm in my Laneys but nothing JV about this balling

I lost my deal, got with Will he seen a nigga genius

My rapping skills is on Chapel Hill but you ain't see it

Eyes low, pyro

Grape swisher, my 5's on

My opposition decline slow

My J's straight out of China like baby Cairo

Shout out to Tyga but my squad Balenciaga

One of the rarest in flyest niggas to rep the chocolate

It was all a dream, it was all a dream

Never Michael Jeffrey in 17s, I'm staying with my team

No bullshit loyalty rare

And don't worry 'bout it shawty we here

Game running, wanna know my hotel and who phone to ring when she coming

I keep it one hundred, get love from the hoes

But it's money over bitches, nothing above it

Like the weed loud like my engine when I speed up

Bitches holding they weave, rolling trees with they pretty feet up

Them suckas often imitate but they can't be us

So super high, look in the sky when you wanna see me bruh

Cut my speakers up, drowning out what the critics say

Just continue to smoke and remain G as fuck

She leave once it's a known fact

That she ain't coming back
