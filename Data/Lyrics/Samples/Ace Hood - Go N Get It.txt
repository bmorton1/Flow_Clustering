Uh
Money the root of evil guess I’m the devil then
Bag full of dead faces like Afghanistan
Hundred K or better, custom made Beretta's
How about that paper cheddar
Hoppin' out that bentley leather
Tell em get a low, low as death
Big face and a racks uphill
Don't grind and a nigga don't shine fuck you gotta get mine
Big dough, big money you’re mine
Runnin like to the sun up rise
Money it never sleeps, got bags up under my eyes
Just know I gotta get it mama very sickly puls im expect twin
That's just what heaven sent me
God fearin' nigga this I who in the flesh
Who won't let my people sore
God bless my soul to rest

Ok now ridin' round with the rocket
Nigga tryin to steal my flow tho'
Thank you for the drama
We the best will be that logo
Ok back upon my dough shit
Slidin on in them two six
Life’s do, run no, baby sees plus rent
Nigga just no doubt no im out chere you
Tote my 9 without fear
Won’t shit niggas pussy, yeah I'm talkin paps smear
No doubt me as my dick-o, tryin get my mom on pay roll
And I'm put my rim on benz-o, get in the h-e with the bunch low
Dick in the (?) when the punch low
I’m sick and tired of cryin, Tired of nickles and dimes
Look in her in her eyes but I know your sun gonna rise
Cause I'm a God fearin nigga ‘cause I am in the flesh
Who won't let my family starve god bless my soul to rest
