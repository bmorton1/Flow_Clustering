I saw with your man
Smiling, huh, a coach bag in your hand
I was laying in the coup with my hat turned back
We caught eyes for a moment, and that was that
So skated off, as you strolled off
Looking at them legs, god damn they looked so soft (so fine)
I gotta take ya from your man that's my mision
If his love is real he got ta handle competition
You only knew about 5 months (that's right)
Besides he drinks too much and smokes too many blunts
And I've been working out everyday thinking bout you
Looking at my own eyes in the rear view
Cathchin flash backs of our eye contact
Wish I could lay ya on your stomach and caress your back
I would hold ya in my arms and ease your fears
I can't believe it, I hadn't had a crush in years

I see you at the bus stop waitin everyday
Your man must think its safe for you to travel that way
But I don't want ta violate your relationship
So I lay back in the cut with a crush that'a trip
Still he can't stop me from having day dreams
Tounging you down with huh vanilla ice cream
Kissing on your thighs in the moonlight
Searching your body with my tounge girl all night
I wonder one day could it be, simple dreams turnin into reality
Our love would come down so naturally
We would walk down the isle of destiny
What your man got his hustle on gotcha type scared
Break ya off a little chump change to do your hair
That seems to be enough to satisfy your needs
But there's a deeper level if you just follow my lead
Hey lover

Last week I saw ya at the mall
Standing at the pay phone bout to make a call
I had a vision it was me on the other end
Telling you come by and then you walked in
I touched you gently with my hands
We talked about traveling the distant lands
Escaping all the madness out here in the world
Becomin my wife no longer my girl
Then, you let your dress fall down to the floor
I kissed you softly and you yearned for more
We experienced pleasure unparallel
Into an ocean of love we both fell
Swimming in the timeless, currents of pure bliss
Fantasies interchanging with each kiss
Undying passion unities our souls
Togehter we swim until the point of no control
But its a fantasy it(that,you) won't come true
We never even spoke and your man (still) love you
So I'm gonna keep all these feelins inside
Keep my dreams alive until the right time
