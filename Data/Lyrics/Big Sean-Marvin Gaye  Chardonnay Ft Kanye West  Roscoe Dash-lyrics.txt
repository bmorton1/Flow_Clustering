Marvin Gaye  Chardonnay Ft Kanye West  Roscoe Dash
[Hook: Roscoe Dash]
Early in the morning when she’s all alone
I’mma take my time, do it how we want it
Just to set the mood, girl
I brought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

[Kanye]
Hold up, hold up, hold up (etc.) yeah

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
She love the way I’m doing it (She do it)
So GOOD she won't put my tattoo on it
Bottom line is, you the finest
Gave you a new name, what's that? My bitch
Hold up, hold up, whoa there, let's capture this moment
If I hit it then I own it, marijuanin' every mornin
And patroning girl, we groaning
But that pussy got me feeling like a kid
With the street lights on, street lights on?
You know I gotta go in 'til it’s

[Hook: Roscoe Dash]
Early in the morning when she’s all alone
I’mma take my time, do it how we want it
Just to set the mood, girl
I bought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay (So just let the song play)
The long way, the strong way, it’s our day, it’s our way
This was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Hold up, talk to the, talk to the hand
Bitch, you talking to a grown ass man
It’s like, way-way-way too much up in your pants
For us not to make the bed squeak (There goes the bed sheets)
Everybody rip the swag off 'fore I rip the tag off
Why my pants sag off? Cause I’m rapping my ass off
Flow so ugly, money so handsome
This the fucking anthem, get it? The fucking anthem

[Hook]

[Kanye]
I be saying I, uh, I think.. when I know, uh, just because..

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I don’t really wanna, uh, talk too much shit
But you love it when I talk like I lost it
And I love how you look when you blazin’
And I swear you turn at least half Asian
And we about to have a liaison
She so cool, give head with her shades on
You should just go and throw a cape on
And it’s just so amazing (So amazing, so amazing)

[Big Sean]
Take it to the car, bloop, bloop
That shit look like I’m speed racing
Leavin' with me, it’ll boost your reputation
West side is where I’m stationed
Spend all night, just champagne tasting
Ain't no rush girl, let's just pace it 'til it's

[Hook]
