Big Punisher
Still Not A Player
[Hook]
I don't wanna be a player no more
I'm not a player; I just fuck a lot
But Big Punisher, still got what you're looking for
For my thugs, baby, for my thugs

Uptown baby, uptown
Don't wanna be, don't wanna be
I don't wanna be a player no more
I'm not a player; I just fuck a lot
But you know Big Pun and Joe still down by law
Who's down to fuck a lot

[Verse 1]
I'm still not a player, but you still a hater
Elevator to the top, ha see you later, I'm gone
Penthouse suite, Penthouse freaks
In-house beats French comteese, 10 thou' piece
Rent-out lease with an option to buy
Copping a 5-0 Benz for when I'm not far up in the sky
Puffing the lye from my Twinzito
Up in the Benzito with my kiko from Queens nicknamed Perico
We go back like PA's and wearing PJ's
Now we reach the peakage, running trains for three days
Who want to ride it; won't cost you a dollar
Whether soft or harder of course you still gonna holla
My my, I'm big huh
I rip my prick through your hooters
I'm sick, you couldn't measure my dick with six rulers, hold up
Choola, I'm all about getting loot
But I knock that boot if you out to get koofed

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I love from butter pecan to blackberry molass'
I don't discriminate, I regulate every shade of the ass
Long as you show class and pass my test
Fat ass and breasts, highly intelligent bachelorettes
That's the best, I won't settle for less
I want a ghetto brunette with unforgettable sex
I lay your head on my chest; and feel my heartbeat
We can park the Jeep, pump Mobb Deep and just spark the leaf
It's hard to creep since I found Joe
Every pretty, round, brown ho wanna go down low
But this Boogie Down professional I'mma let you know
Once I put the blows, get your clothes, cause you got to go
I could go downstairs, little brown hairs everywhere
You nasty, Twin; I don't care
Round here they call me Big Pun, if you with the big guns
Thick tongue, known to make the chicks come

[Outro x2]
In the hot tub, popping bubbly
Rubbing your spot love, got you screaming punish me
But it don't stop, watch the Pun get wicked
When I stick it even Luke be like, don't stop, get it, get it

[Hook]

Boricua, morena
Boricua, morena
