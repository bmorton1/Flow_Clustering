Kendrick Lamar
Rigamortus
[Intro]
Alright, here we go, third take, real quick Ali

[Refrain]
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson with madness, now just imagine the magic
I light to asses, don't ask for your favorite rapper

(He dead) Yessir (Amen) Chuuch
(He dead) I killed him (Amen) Bitch

[Premier Couplet]
And this is rigamortis and it's gorgeous when you die
Ali recorded and I'm Morpheus, the Matrix of my mind
I'm out the orbit, you an orphan and a hairdresser combined
I'm on the toilet when I rhyme if you the shit then I decline
I climax where you begin and then I end on Cloud 9
And that's important when you morph into a angel in the sky
And don't be forging all my signatures, my listeners reply
And tell me that you biting style, you got a hell of an appetite
And I'mma be here for a while just buckle up before the ride
Or knuckle up if you could fight, we always making them duck or die
A suit and tie is suitable and usual in suicide
CSI just might investigate this fucking parasite

[Deuxième Couplet]
(He dead, amen) That's what they telling me
Aim it at your celebrity, this is studio felony
Ferragami so many and cool enough for the 70's
Nigga, payback's a bitch and bitch you been living in debt with me
That I more than especially, leave a call on his mother voicemail
To say that he rest in peace, bigger chopper the recipe
Wrestling, that's irrelevant rather rest at your residence
Whistling to the melody couldn't think of a better D
Better be on your P and Q, it's just me Jay Rock, Soul and Q
Solar system and barbecue, nothing else you can do

(He dead) Yup-yup (Amen) I killed him
(He dead) Haha (Amen) Amen

[Refrain]

[Troisième Couplet]
I rapped him and made him Casper, I captured the likes of NASA
My pedigree to fly past ya, I pass the weed to the pastor
We all are sinners, won't you send us to bible study faster
Your hypocrite-esque reaction a blasphemy
I assassin my casualty and it's casually done and tell 'em my salary come
A lump sum of hundreds don't talk to be 'bout no money
The sun is under my feet and I come in peace to compete
I don't run if you rather leap, my statistics go up in weeks
And I go visit the nearest creek and I get busy on many MC
Really ballistic, anybody can see any assistance
Everybody done see some persistence
Recognize I be really too vicious
The permanent beast and the demolition
Breaking up the streets, better partition
Better dot your T and I gon' mention
How the far you see putting my dick in the rap industry
Everybody bitchin', getting mad at me
Recognize Kendrick in the battery
And I'm charged up and the catastrophe
Is charged up and the audacity
And y'all fucks, never could hassle me
And y'all luck, just ran out you'll see

(He dead) Yup-yup (Amen) I know
(He dead) For sure (Amen) Amen

[Refrain]
