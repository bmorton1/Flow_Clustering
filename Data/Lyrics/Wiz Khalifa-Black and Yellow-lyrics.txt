Wiz Khalifa
Black and Yellow
[Verse 1]
Reppin 49ers cuz thats their name
At candlestick while im watching that game
Running around town hopping on planes
Canton Ohio in the hall of fame
Wearing number 7 like Colin Kaep
Talking super bowl rings
He's bringing them back
On the west coast of the United States
Watch out for Darius Fleming Number 58
Red and White flying thru the skies
Thousands of hits
As youre watching this rise
Throwing touchdowns K-A-E-P
Number seven as they looking at me
Recording this song right over this beat
On your iPhone have this on repeat
San Francisco on the way to the superdome
Super bowl rings we're bringin them home
Runnin, passin
The pistols in fashion
Tatted up as you see
Everyone look at me
Out here by the bay
Ballin hard everyday
Out here bout to throw
Everybody bout to know
Throwin touchdowns K-A-E-P
Number seven when they lookin at me
Five years old
Hold and wait
On the west coast of the United States
Back with another hit
Straight from the DYT
Reppin 49ers
As I'm rapping organically
Throwing all these touchdowns like I have a visa
Singing this song more like Wiz Khalifa
Black and Yellow red and white
As these raps take flight
Number 7, number 2
David Akers kicking thru
Wearing diamonds singing loud
San Fran's what we're bout
Number seven coming thru
Winning games is what we do
