[Intro]
Its young Khalifa man
Paper Plane Gang
5-0-1 young
Aye, shout out to my brother Spitta, man
I just wanted to say that
And your bitch could see this shit from across the street nigga
It's pimpin' over here
Macaroni
Ta-Ha!
Kush & Orange Juice nigga
What up Chevy
Jerm I see you
Cardo On The Beat

[Verse 1]
Uh, I don't love 'em, I don't chase 'em I duck 'em
Smoke somethin', go to a new state soon as I fuck 'em
Niggas be pressed for pussy, it ain't nothing
Instead of worrying about who that bitch fuckin', why don't you get you some money
9 times out of 10 she see me stuntin'
Game running, wanna know my hotel and who phone to ring when she coming
I keep it one hundred, get love from the hoes
But it's money over bitches, nothing above it
Like the weed loud like my engine when I speed up
Bitches holding they weave, rolling trees with they pretty feet up
Them suckas often imitate but they can't be us
So super high, look in the sky when you wanna see me bruh
Cut my speakers up, drowning out what the critics say
Just continue to smoke and remain G as fuck
Polo socks match my polo hat
She leave once it's a known fact
That she ain't coming back
Now Taylor Gang that

[Hook]
And ain't shit change, but the amount of horses in my motor when I switch lanes
And I beat 'em blinding with them diamonds in my big chain
Heavy in the game little homie, I'm doing big things
And them bitches they memorized, they recognize
I keep it so G (I keep it so G)
Get you some money fuckin' with me (fuckin' with me)

[Verse 2]
I don't love 'em, I don't chase 'em, I duck 'em
Try to get paper how the fucker don't know shit about her
I take you up where it's cloudy, ain't one them lames still rockin' prada
I go to Louie and blow a couple thousand
One of my baddest bitches, rollin' up while I'm driving
And she don't even smoke just hit it once while she light it
My game tight, seal and sign it
Them niggas just playing, ain't really ballin', saying they being honest
Claiming, that's your wife but we can't call it
She all in my hotel suite at 3 in the morning
Taking her clothes off, inhaling weed and coughing
Ain't her first time chiefing but say she don't do this often
Since I was 16, I had all the intentions to keep it G
Take niggas hoes, and smoke hella trees with em
As for your team, you niggas in the stands, you just lookin'
I'm a pro to these rookies and plan is still paper over....pussy

[Hook]

[Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah nigga, this shit just don't sound cool
This what we go to sleep to, wake up to
Kush and Orange Juice nigga
Got your bitch cooking them cheese eggs too. Got paper in my pocket
Taylor Gang what's up?
See y'all niggas man
We done fucked over 'em this year, it's a wrap
Hahahaha
Yeah. We don't want no more sucker shit, ever
