It's times like this that I've gotta crack a smile
If it's about anything, then it's gotta be style
What happens now? A better man can hold the mic and do the proving
Dres, of the Black Sheep Yo, let's get the Sheep moving
I'd like to pay a tribute, to what, to knocking boots
I'm single and I mingle if ya jingle I play roots
But there's another, the other
The brother on the cover
I brought along, I brought along
I brought along, Lawnge
I duo not a trio move your bootie cause I say so
Be outlasting or not busting Black Sheep not your average Joe
Now I hold a microphone, but this is what I wanted
A pocket full of punani, better me than those that front it
Dropping bombs, lovely, make 'em jet without their Jetta
Keep fronting if you're wanting but I bet ya the Beretta
Punctuates and exclamates, the lingo I let go
Not that it's my style cuz I let go my ego
Be it just us, just you or just me or just who
Never am I full, gotta to get residuals
Pronto, Tonto
Was engine number nine
I'm out to get the nickels, quarters, pennies and the dimes
