De La Soul
Stakes Is High

[Verse 1]
The instamatic focal point bringing damage to your boroughs
Be some brothers from the east with them beats that be thorough
Got the solar gravitation so I'm bound to pull it
I gets down like brothers are found ducking from bullets
Gun control means using both hands in my land
Where it's all about the cautious livin'
Migrating to a higher form of consequence, compliments
Of strugglin', that shouldn't be notable
Man every word I say should be a hip hop quotable
