Camp Lo
Coolie High
[Hook]
You need to come inside and check Lo
Relax yourself and let the sugar love flow
Coolie High keeps you wide

[Verse 1 - Geechi Suede]
It's rainin' Alizé
I'm floatin' through the Holland tunnel swervin'
I'm diggin' on the Sheba
Pullin' cheeba she be splurgin'
We lurkin' with the coon
Cause we be murkin' from the boogie
And shittin' on them crabs
Cause they jive fake and woolly

[Verse 2 - Sonny Cheeba]
Yeah, très shots of life for all night you dig it
Camp-ah hotta pinata
Too big quiver, get hipper
Spillin' coffee inside my automo 'Eldo
Crackin' satin and leather
What's happenin' bullet convincer
Cash straight outta comic books
Catchin' the flurry
Keep your eye on the Lo
Or miss the heaven we brewin'

[Verse 3 - Geechi Suede]
Cats be comin' with hammers and drivers
With the Buddhas and Rugers
Inside Cruisers and Rovers
Diamond crooks, takin' it over
With razors and cutters
With the sugar and butters
Pimpin' Caesars in leathers
We live for Coolie High treasures
And..

[Verse 4 - Sonny Cheeba]
Check the queen bee Lady Ree diggin' Grace
Check the place 3 o'clock sharp, no we ain't
Fred and Cot bring it in the paint no such thing
Blasts of dynamite sing my superfly to the
Cleopatra in the casino with gold sugar
Dig my harlequin
And drench you with my diner garments

[Verse 5 - Geechi Suede]
From borough to borough in the Montero slidin' it thorough
With bottles of Asti Spumante to tranquilize my heaven
Count seven, we gettin' explicit shootin' sugar to the shorties
Luchini to spare, let me see your istals in the air
Word life

[Hook]

[Verse 6 - Geechi Suede]
Lo keeps the party live
The 80 proof is leakin' got me sceechin' Jersey Drive
We screamin' cause we villains, enough caliber is bringin
I'm layin' in the purple rain until I see some action
We movin' motionless, continuous and that's what's happenin'

[Verse 7 - Sonny Cheeba]
We got the bubbly pourin' through me in Cleopatra's casino
See back in Coolie High, jackin' Jitterbugs and Look Obsession
Dolemite's outta sight, anti-hottest cats in the city
On the money takin' the tri-state under sore savant
Billy Holidayin' the Foxy Browns with my Harlequins
That penny he repellin', reflectin' crystals, it's Hollywood

[Verse 8 - Geechi Suede]
Don't pull the stars
Cause we lickin' Cuban cigars and sippin' Moe
Playin' the jigga cotton
The figgas on the low
Blessin' the dimes
Keepin' my Camp is on the higher flow
Livin' the crimes, hittin' them sly
For the c-notes

[Verse 9 - Sonny Cheeba]
Yo, prince of the city
Pourin' right on the JJ's and Sautee
Cab Calloway the last of the finest Shot Sirus
Crisis is comin'
Lower with Jiggas less to zero that
Sex the Lo, dice the Lo
I'll tell you what
On the night vision decision underneath the silver moon
Boy from company C, a day sugar love

[Verse 10 - Geechi Suede]
Your boy chief be for stonin', robbin
Chero be for midnight
The safety's off the toaster
And my shadow's by the moonlight
Cause Native's on the levels and the Lo is on the EQ
My stamina is sugar
And it's love, love forever y'all

[Hook]
