No sleep 'til - Brooklyn

[Ad-Rock] Foot on the pedal - never ever false metal
Engine running hotter than a boiling kettle
My job's ain't a job - it's a damn good time
City to city - I'm running my rhymes

[Mike D] On location - touring around the nation
Beastie Boys always on vacation
Itchy trigger finger but a stable turntable
[MCA] I do what I do best because I'm illing and able
[Mike D/Ad-Rock] Ain't no faking - your money I'm taking
[ADR] Going coast to coast - watching all the girlies shaking
[MCA] While you're at the job working nine to five
The Beastie Boys at the Garden - cold kickin' it live

No sleep till
[All] Another plane - another train
Another bottle in the brain
Another girl - another Fight
Another drive all night

[MD] Our manager's crazy - he always smokes dust
[MCA] He's got his own room at the back of the bus
[ADR] Tour around the world - you rock around the clock
[MD] Plane to hotel - girls on the jock
[MCA] We're trashing hotels like it's going out of style
[ADR] Getting paid along the way cause it's worth your while
Four on the floor, [MD] Ad-Rock's out the door
MCA's in the back cause he's sleepin' with a whore
[ADR] We got a safe in the trunk with money in a stack
[MD] With dice in the front and Brooklyn's in the back
White boys got more rhymes

No sleep till
No sleep till Brooklyn
No sleep till Brooklyn

[ADR] Ain't seen the light since we started this band
So, MCA, get on the mic, my man

[MCA] Born and bred Brooklyn - U.S.A
They call me Adam Yauch - but I'm M.C.A
Like a lemon to a lime - a lime to a lemon
I sip the def ale with all the fly women

[MD] Got limos, arena, and TV shows
Autograph pictures and classy hoes

[ADR] Step off, Holmes - get out of my way
Taxing little girlies form here to L.A

[MCA] Waking up before I get to sleep
[All] Cause I'll be rocking this party eight days a week
