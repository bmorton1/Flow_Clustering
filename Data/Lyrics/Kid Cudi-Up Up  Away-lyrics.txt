Kid Cudi
Up Up  Away
[Verse 1]
Now when the sun come up
I'll be there to say what up
In the morning brush my teeth
Find that clip I been looking
For since last night
I feel so caught up in a bud
I flow some round in my bedroom, turn around, see myself in the mirror
I guess I'm cool, and no sappy thoughts in my head
I'm feeling like I'm Peter Pan, minus the tights
And the fairy's happy to see how far I've come, to the same place
It began: my dream and imaginations
Perfectly at peace so I move along a bit higher

[Hook x2]
I'll be up, up, and away
Up, up, and away
Cause they gonna judge me anyway, so whatever

[Verse 2]
I learn, I see the dreams are made, so I'm cooler now
I could take care of my mom and my little niece Zuri, so
Sing along lil mama, you ain't gotta worry bout no drama, no
I'll provide for friends and fam and fans
Cleveland city grinding man, stay afloat, the key is hope
I never let a motherfucka break me, dawg
Who gives a fuck if a nigga don't like your steeze?
Tell em to buzz off your n-u-t's
We don't care what people say
Dudes who critique your clothes are most gay
I ain't gotta wait for no one
If I wanna fly, I could fly for freedom, hey!

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Wake up wake up wake wake up
Wake up wake up wake wake up
(Yeah! We'll be rolling one up)

[Hook]

[Common - Narrating]
The end is never the end. A new challenge awaits
A test no man could be prepared for
A new hell he must conquer and destroy
A new level of growth he must confront himself
The machine in the ghost within
This is the journey of the man on the moon
